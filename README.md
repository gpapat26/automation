1.Parallel automation with Cucumber-JVM and Jenkins Integration
2.Create 5 Scenarios that prove to run in parallel 
3.Each Thread creates its own Instance of the Step Definition Class and thus Driver objects and thus ui tests dont mix.
4.Instance variables are saved from step 1 to Step 2 and can be re-used
